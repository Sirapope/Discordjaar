                    <h3>Prologue</h3>
                    <p>Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends around the world while playing games online. Since childhood, founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a love of video games, cherishing the friendships and connections that formed while playing them. At the time, all the tools built for this job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan knew they could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found through gaming.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter One</h3>
                    <p>So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People from all over the world loved it. Discord made it easy to genuinely communicate with friends, going beyond casual talking. Friends were staying in touch with their various communities. Discord was making it easy to participate in conversation, hopping around text, voice and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal was simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into with your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began to take off, and devoted people who loved our product sprung up around the world.</p>

                    <h3>Where are we new?</h3>
                    <p>Discord is used by everyone from local hiking clubs, to art communities, to study groups. Discord has millions of people creating places for their friends and communities, talking for upwards of 4 hours per day on the platform. Discord is now where the world talks, hangs out, and builds relationships. Discord lets anyone create a space to find belonging—just like it did for Jason and Stan.</p>

            <p>Discord is working toward building true connections around play and shared experiences, where genuine human connection is a click, text chat, or voice call away. A place where everyone can find belonging.
